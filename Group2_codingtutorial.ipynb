We have also drawn the conclusion that there could be numerous other factors that are also affecting the economic damage being observed - such as inflation, or other situational economic variability. Additionally, since natural disasters can be quite volatile in its own ways and its impact can vary from time to time, it can be difficult to gather results from this dataset alone."
